Inheritance
------------
.in inheritance is a powerful object oriented programming in python
.The technique of creating a newclass from an existing class is 
called inhertance
. the old class is called the baseclass or parent class
. new class is called derived class or child class or subclass

syntax of inheritance

class baseclass:
	body of baseclass

class derivedclass(baseclass):
	bodyof derivedclass

In heritance we have few types

.Siglelevel inheritance
	in singlelevel inheritance a class can be derived from a 
	single baseclass

class baseclass:
  statements

class derivedclass(baseclass)
   statements

obj=derivedclass
obj.var
obj.methodname

.multiple inheritance
when a derived class inherites features from more than one baseclass
is called multiple inheritance

multiple inheritance syntax

class baseclass1:
	statements

class basecalss2"
     statements

class derivedclass(baseclass1,baseclass2,...baseclassn):
	stements

.multilevel inheritance

the technique of deriving a class from an already derived class
is called multivel inheritance

syntax 

class baseclass:
	statements

class derived class1(baseclass):
    statements

class derived class2(derivedclass1):
	statements
